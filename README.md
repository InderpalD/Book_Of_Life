# Welcome to the Book of Life
Inspired by Bill Simmons' Book of Basketball, this journaling site will feature a broad scope of life lessons that have helped me most in advancing my career, improving my health, and living my optimal life. 

As I continue to learn more about life and find what works best for me, I will add posts to the site. Each post will represent some challenge I did or mindset that I took on for a period of time, and will include an analysis of what makes it great and why I wish to document it for myself and others to incorporate it into our lives. 

I encourage you all to make an account and post your own lessons for life as well.I am always interested in what makes people who they are, what fuels them, and the things they found which they believe are important for a happy life. Let's read about eachother's favorites, and continue to learn new habits and skills.
